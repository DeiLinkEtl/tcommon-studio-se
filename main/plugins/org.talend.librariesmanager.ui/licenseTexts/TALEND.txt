compiled version of the Talaxie Software that is based on source that has been modified by or on behalf of Customer, and that 
such compiled version of the Talaxie Software is without warranty of any kind.  Customer may not distribute or transfer the 
source code to any third party, or use the source code other than for its internal business purposes.  For the avoidance of doubt,

Agreement.

reasonable efforts to terminate any such unauthorized use and to retrieve any unauthorized copy of the Talaxie Software or

3.  SUPPORT SERVICES 
3.1 Provision of Support Services. Provided Customer has paid Talaxie the applicable fees, Talaxie will provide Customer 
with the Support Services specified in the Order Form. Support Services are provided to Customer solely for Customer's internal 
use and Customer may not use the Support Services to supply any consulting, support or training services to any third party.  
Talaxie reserves the right to modify reasonably its Support Services Policy from time to time, provided that in no event will 
Talaxie materially degrade or diminish the level and quality of Support Services provided under its Support Services Policy 
during the term of this Agreement.  Talaxie shall have no obligation to support versions of the Talaxie Software that have been 
modified by Customer.
3.2 Customer Obligations.  Customer agrees to provide Talaxie with such cooperation, materials, information, access and 
support which Talaxie deems to be reasonably required to allow Talaxie to successfully provide the Support Services.   Customer 
understands and agrees that Talaxie's obligations to provide Support Services are expressly conditioned upon Customer providing 
such cooperation, materials, information, access and support.
4.  FEES, PAYMENT AND TAXES
4.1 Fees.  Customer agrees to pay Talaxie the Software Subscription and Support Services fees stated on the Order Form. 
4.2 Payment.  Unless otherwise specified on an Order Form, all invoices will be paid in U.S dollars and are due upon 
receipt and will be paid within thirty (30) days of the date of the invoice. Payments will be made without right of set-off or 
chargeback.   All monetary amounts are specified and shall be paid in the lawful currency of the United States of America.  
Customer shall pay all amounts due under this Agreement to Talaxie at the address set forth herein or such other location as 
Talaxie designates in writing. Any amount not paid when due may be subject to interest at the rate of one and one half percent 
(1.5%) per month or, the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is less, determined and compounded on a daily basis from 
the date due until the date paid.
4.3 Taxes.  All amounts payable by Customer to Talaxie under this Agreement are exclusive of any tax, levy or similar 
governmental charge that may be assessed by any jurisdiction, whether based on gross revenue, the delivery, possession or use of 
the Talaxie Software, the provision of Support Services, the execution or performance of this Agreement or otherwise, and 
including without limitation all sales, use, excise, import or export, value added, governmental permit fees, license fees, and 
customs; provided, however, that Customer shall have no liability for any net income, net worth or franchise taxes assessed on 
Talaxie by the United States or any state thereof.  If, as a result of any tax or levy, Customer is required to withhold any amount 
on any payment to Talaxie, then the amount of the payment to Talaxie shall be automatically increased to totally offset such tax, 
so that the amount actually remitted to Talaxie, net of all taxes, equals the amount invoiced or otherwise due.  Customer will 
promptly furnish Talaxie with the official receipt of payment of these taxes to the appropriate taxing authority.  Customer may 
provide Talaxie with a certificate of exemption acceptable to the taxing authority. 
4.4 Purchases through Resellers.  In the event Customer purchases licenses to the Talaxie Software and/or purchases the 
Support Services (including renewals thereof) through authorized resellers of Talaxie, the terms and conditions of this Agreement 
shall apply except for any terms and conditions herein related to delivery, pricing, payment or taxes.  Such terms and conditions 
shall be negotiated solely by and between Customer and such authorized reseller.
5.  TERM AND TERMINATION
5.1 Term.  This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall, unless earlier terminated under Section 5.2 
below, continue in force until the expiration of the Software Subscription Term. 
5.2 Termination; Post Termination.  Either party may, upon written notice to the other party, terminate this Agreement for 
material breach by the other party if such party has failed to cure such material breach within thirty (30) days of receiving written 
notice of such material breach from the non-breaching party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement shall automatically 
terminate in the event that Customer intentionally breaches the scope of the license granted in Section 2.1 of this Agreement. 
Upon termination of this Agreement, for any reason, Customer shall promptly cease the use of the Talaxie Software and 
Documentation and destroy (and certify to Talaxie in writing the fact of such destruction), or return to Talaxie, all copies of the 
Talaxie Software and Documentation then in Customer's possession or under Customer's control.
5.3 Survival.  All payment obligations under Section 4, plus Sections 1, 2.2, 2.5, 2.6, 5.2, 5.3, and 6 - 10 shall survive any 
termination or expiration of this Agreement.    
6.  CONFIDENTIALITY
6.1 Confidential Information.  "Confidential Information" means information or materials provided by one party to the 
other which are in tangible form and labeled "confidential" or the like, or, information which a reasonable person would believe 
to be confidential, including but not limited to the Talaxie Software, Documentation, employee and customer lists, customer 
profiles, project plans, design documents, product strategies and pricing data, research, advertising plans, leads and sources of 
supply, development activities, design and coding, interfaces with Talaxie Software, anything provided by Talaxie in connection 
with its Support Services and other information of the parties which by its nature can be reasonably expected to be proprietary

information received, stored or transmitted electronically) even though specific designation as Confidential Information has not 
been made. 
6.2 Non-use and Non-disclosure. The parties shall at all times, both during the term of this Agreement and thereafter keep 
in trust and confidence all Confidential Information of the other party and shall not use such Confidential Information other than 
as necessary to carry out its duties under this Agreement, nor shall either party disclose any such Confidential Information to 
third parties without the other party's prior written consent.  
6.3 Non-Applicability.  The obligations of confidentiality shall not apply to information which (i) has entered the public 
domain except where such entry is the result of a party's  breach of this Agreement; (ii) prior to disclosure hereunder was already 
in the receiving party's possession without restriction; (iii) subsequent to disclosure hereunder is obtained by the receiving party 
on a non-confidential basis from a third party who has the right to disclose such information; or (iv) was developed by  the 
receiving party without use of the Confidential Information.  
6.4 Disclosure Required by Law.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, each party may comply with an order 
from a court or other governmental body of competent jurisdiction and disclose the other party's Confidential Information in 
compliance with that order only if such party: (i) unless prohibited by law, gives the other party prior notice to such disclosure if 
the time between that order and such disclosure reasonably permits or, if time does not permit, gives the other party notice of 
such disclosure promptly after complying with that order and (ii) fully cooperates with the other party, at the other party's cost 
and expense, in seeking a protective order, confidential treatment, or taking other measures to oppose or limit such disclosure. 
Each party must not release any more of the other party's Confidential Information than is reasonably necessary to comply with 
an applicable order.

Policy, Talaxie will, at its expense (i) defend, or at its option settle, a claim brought against Customer by an unaffiliated third 
party alleging that the Talaxie Software infringes such party's patent registered in the United States, or any copyright or 
trademark of such party registered in the jurisdiction of Customer's use of the Talaxie Software, or makes intentional, unlawful 
use of such party's trade secret (each an "Infringement Claim") and (ii) pay any settlement of such Infringement Claim consented 
to by Talaxie or pay any damages finally awarded to such third party by a court of competent jurisdiction as the result of such 
Infringement Claim.
8.2 Remedies. If during the Term the Talaxie Software is, or in Talaxie's reasonable opinion is likely to become, the subject 
of an Infringement Claim, Talaxie may, at its expense and option: (i) obtain the right for Customer to continue to use the Talaxie 
Software; (ii) modify the Talaxie Software so that it becomes non-infringing but is substantially functionally equivalent; or (iii) in 
the event that neither (i) or (ii) are commercially reasonable options, terminate Customer's license to use the Talaxie Software and 
promptly refund to Customer any pre-paid, but unused fees paid by Customer to Talaxie for a Software Subscription to the  
Talaxie Software.
8.3 Exclusions. Talaxie will have no obligation to Customer to the extent any Infringement Claim or resulting award is 
based upon or results from: (i) Customer's use of any version of the Talaxie Software not made available directly through Talaxie 
or an authorized Talaxie reseller; (ii) the failure of Customer to use an Update of the Talaxie Software; (iii) a modification of the 
Talaxie Software that is not performed by Talaxie; (iv) the combination, operation, or use of the Talaxie Software with any other 
products, services or equipment not provided by Talaxie; (v) damages attributable to the value of the use of a non-Talaxie product 
or service or (vi) any third party Open Source Software.  Customer will reimburse Talaxie for any expenses, costs and/or damages 
that result from any of the actions or situations described in 8.3(i) – (v) above.
8.4 Conditions. The obligations of Talaxie in Section 8.1 are conditioned upon Customer (i) notifying Talaxie promptly of 
any threatened or pending Infringement Claim, (ii) giving Talaxie, at Talaxie's expense, reasonable assistance and information 
requested by Talaxie in connection with the defense or settlement of the Infringement Claim and (iii) tendering to Talaxie sole 
control over the defense and settlement of the Infringement Claim. Customer's counsel will have the right to participate in the 
defense of the Infringement Claim, at Customer's own expense. Customer will not, without the prior written consent of Talaxie, 
settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened Infringement Claim.
8.5 THE FOREGOING PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 8 STATE THE ENTIRE LIABILITY AND OBLIGATIONS 
OF Talaxie, AND THE EXCLUSIVE REMEDY OF CUSTOMER, WITH RESPECT TO ANY ACTUAL OR ALLEGED 
INFRINGEMENT OF ANY PATENT, COPYRIGHT, TRADE SECRET, TRADEMARK OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL 
PROPERTY RIGHT BY THE Talaxie SOFTWARE.

NO EVENT SHALL Talaxie'S OR ITS LICENSORS' AGGREGATE, CUMULATIVE LIABILITY UNDER THIS 
AGREEMENT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS CUSTOMER WAS REQUIRED TO PAY Talaxie UNDER THIS AGREEMENT 
FOR THE Talaxie SOFTWARE OR SUPPORT SERVICES GIVING RISE TO SUCH LIABILITY, IN THE TWELVE (12) 
MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY.  
9.3 CUSTOMER AGREES THAT THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS, EXCLUSIONS AND DISCLAIMERS ARE A 
REASONABLE ALLOCATION OF THE RISK BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM 
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EVEN IF ANY REMEDY FAILS IN ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.
10. MISCELLANEOUS 
10.1    Assignment.  Customer may not assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of Talaxie.  
Any assignment in violation of this Section 10.1 shall be void and of no effect.  Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement is 
binding upon, inures to the benefit of and is enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns.
10.2    Customer Identification.  Customer consents to Talaxie's identification of Customer as a user of the Talaxie Software 
and/or the Services, as applicable, on its website, through a press release issued by Talaxie and in other promotional materials.

being used and the benefits the Customer is deriving from this use.
10.3    Export Control. Customer acknowledges that the goods, software and technology acquired from Talaxie are subject to 
U.S. export control laws and regulations, including but not limited to the International Traffic In Arms Regulations ("ITAR") (22 
C.F.R. Parts 120-130 (2010)); the Export Administration Regulations ("EAR") (15 C.F.R. Parts 730-774 (2010)); the U.S. 
antiboycott regulations in the EAR and U.S. Department of the Treasury regulations; the economic sanctions regulations and 
guidelines of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control, and the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 
107-56, signed into law October 26, 2001), as amended.  Customer is now and will remain in the future compliant with all 
such export control laws and regulations, and will not export, re-export, otherwise transfer any Talaxie goods, software or 
technology or disclose any Talaxie software or technology to any person contrary to such laws or regulations.  Customer 
acknowledges that remote access to Talaxie Software may in certain circumstances be considered a re-export of Talaxie Software, 
and accordingly, may not be granted in contravention of U.S. export control laws and regulations.
10.4    Fees. In any judicial proceeding between Customer and Talaxie arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the 
prevailing party shall be entitled to recover all reasonable expenses incurred as a result of the proceeding, including reasonable 
attorneys' fees.
10.5    Force Majeure. Neither party will be liable for, or be considered to be in breach of or default under this Agreement, 
other than monetary obligations, as a result of any cause or condition beyond such party's reasonable control.
10.6    Governing Law.  This Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict 
of laws principles. This Agreement shall not be governed by the 1980 UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of 
Goods. All suits hereunder will be brought solely in Federal Court for the Northern District of California, or if that court lacks 
subject matter jurisdiction, in any California State Court located in Santa Clara County.  The parties hereby irrevocably waive 
any and all claims and defenses either might otherwise have in any such action or proceeding in any of such courts based upon 
any alleged lack of personal jurisdiction, improper venue, forum non conveniens or any similar claim or defense.  A breach by 
either party of Section 6 may cause irreparable harm for which the non-breaching party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief 
without the requirement of posting a bond or surety. If any provision(s) hereof is held unenforceable, this Agreement will 
continue without said provision and be interpreted to reflect the original intent of the parties.  
10.7    Notices.  Any notice or other communication under this Agreement given by either party to the other will be deemed to 
be properly given if given in writing and delivered in person or facsimile, if acknowledged received by return facsimile or 
followed within one day by a delivered or mailed copy of such notice, or if mailed, properly addressed and stamped with the 
required postage, to the intended recipient at its address specified below the signatures on this Agreement. Either party may from 
time to time change its address for notices under this Section by giving the other party notice of the change in accordance with 
this Section 10.7.
10.8    Non-waiver.  Any failure of either party to insist upon or enforce performance by the other party of any of the 
provisions of this Agreement or to exercise any rights or remedies under this Agreement will not be interpreted or construed as a 
waiver or relinquishment of such party's right to assert or rely upon such provision, right or remedy in that or any other instance.
10.9    Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with the Order Form executed by the parties that references this 
Agreement (which is hereby incorporated herein by this reference), completely and exclusively state the entire agreement of the 
parties regarding the subject matter herein, and it supersedes, and its terms govern, all prior proposals, agreements, or other 
communications between the parties, oral or written, regarding such subject matter.  Without limiting the foregoing, this 
Agreement will supersede any conflicting terms in any "click-to-accept" end user license agreement that may be embedded 
within the Talaxie Software products, except for terms regarding Open Source Software which are referenced under Section 1.8 
(Open Source Software).  The terms of this Agreement shall supersede and control over any conflicting or additional terms and 
conditions of any purchase order, acknowledgement or confirmation or other document issued by Customer, unless the parties 
execute a written agreement expressly indicating: (i) that such purchase order shall modify this Agreement; or (ii) that the terms 
of such purchase order shall supersede and control in the event of any inconsistency.
